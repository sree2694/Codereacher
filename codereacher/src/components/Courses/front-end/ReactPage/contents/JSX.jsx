import React from 'react';

const JSX = () => (
    <div>
        <h2>JSX</h2>
        <p>
            JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing developers to write
            HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to visualize the UI structure in React.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>
{`const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;`}
        </pre>
        <p>While JSX is not mandatory, it is widely used for its readability and simplicity.</p>
    </div>
);

export default JSX;
