            Components are the building blocks of React applications. They allow developers to split the UI into
            independent, reusable pieces, making it easier to manage and scale applications.
        </p>
        <p>Types of components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Class Components</li>
            <li>Functional Components</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Functional components are now preferred due to the introduction of Hooks in React.</p>
